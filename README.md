# dotfiles
Config files of Chris Pierce <cpierce@csdurant.com>

## What are these for?
My dotfiles make simple engineering tasks even better.  I use a lot of these daily and then others ever so often, but when I need them they come in so handy. I've been enhancing these and improving on them over the years and this is a collection of the scripts, functions, and configurations that help me do work.  I hope they are helpful to others as maybe a starting point for creating your own dotfiles repository.
