# Chris Pierce's Dotfiles

This repository contains the configuration files and scripts used by Chris Pierce. Reach out at <cpierce@csdurant.com> for any queries or suggestions.

## Overview

These dotfiles are a culmination of years of refining and enhancing my development environment. They serve to streamline various engineering tasks, making the daily grind smoother and more efficient. While some of these configurations and scripts are part of my daily workflow, others are used less frequently. However, each one has proven its worth time and again.

## Why Share Them?

Over the years, I've realized the value of a well-organized and efficient workspace. By sharing these dotfiles, I hope to provide a starting point for others looking to optimize their own environments. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, feel free to explore, use, or adapt any part of this collection to suit your needs.
